A Stupid-simple engineering environment for systems integration dev rather
than Software Engineering.

Rationale:

Vagrrant is great and everything, but is makes some assumptions that disqualifies
it from full-bore integration dev and test.

* Everything is build from boxes - production systems are'nt we need to build from whole-cloth
* You don't have DNS so inject hosts files - good enough for SWE
* You are always able to reach out to teh interwebs for installation assets
