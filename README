A Stupid-simple engineering environment for systems integration dev rather
than Software Engineering.

Rationale:

Vagrant is great and everything, but is makes some assumptions that disqualifies
it from full-bore integration dev and test.

* Everything is build from boxes - production systems aren't, we need to tailor from whole-cloth
* You don't have DNS so inject hosts files - good enough for SWE
* You are always able to reach out to teh interwebs for installation assets

Implementation:

  DNS Domain: foo.local

  --------+------------+-------------+---------   10.0.30.0/24 (intnet)

     +---------+  +---------+   +---------+  
     | foreman |  |   ipa   |   | guest1  |
     +---------+  +---------+   +---------+

                       |
                  +---------+
                  |  host   |  localhost:2222 => foreman:22
                  +---------+
