A Stupid-simple engineering environment for systems integration rather
than Software Engineering.

Rationale:

Vagrant is great and everything, but is makes some assumptions that disqualifies
it from full-bore integration dev and test.

* Everything is build from boxes - production systems aren't, we need to tailor from whole-cloth
* You don't have DNS so inject hosts files - good enough for SWE
* You are always able to reach out to teh interwebs for installation assets

Implementation:

  DNS Domain: foo.local

  |--------+------------+-------------+---------|   10.0.30.0/24 (intnet)
           |            |             |
      +---------+  +---------+   +---------+  
      | foreman |  |   ipa   |   | guest1  |
      +---------+  +---------+   +---------+  
           |
  |--------+------------+-----------------------|   X.X.X.X (NAT)
                        |
                   +---------+
                   |  host   |
                   +---------+

                   localhost:2222 => foreman:22
                   localhost:9080 => SOCKS Proxy

Prerequisites:

* Linux with VirtualBox
* macOS with VirtualBox
* Windows 10 with 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' and VirtualBox installed (not yet tested)

Instructions:

1. Download CentOS Minimal ISO (location ~/Downloads assumed)
2. Edit files for your own domain required IP/DHCP/PXE range
3. Insert the contents of tools/ssh_config into ~/.ssh/config
4. # bash foreman/vm-create-foreman.sh
5. When the foreman VM boots off the CDROM:
   * Scroll up to "Install CentOS ..." menu item, then Tap [TAB] key to expose the linux kernel command line
   * add " ks=http://goo.gl/oX4Qd2" to the kernel boot command and tap [ENTER]
6. Let VM build
7. # scp foreman/foreman-install.sh foreman: 
8. run foreman-install.sh

To look at your foreman installation:

1. Open your browser "LAN Settings"
2. Replaces any settings with:
   * SOCKS v5
   * Remote DNS
   * 127.0.01 port 9080
3. Goto https://foreman.foo.local
4. Add the certificate


Todo:

* Get foreman config and repo to a better state
* IPA 
* Do everything from the collective framework
